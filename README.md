### Notes for development

Got tabs set up, and got basic styling set up for headers.

#### Next Steps

1. Start with the styling of the main index (Link Up) tab. I'm going to fetch user info and pics. Have to find where to do that from.
2. Maybe start working on profile next I'm not sure.
3. Want to start figuring out how I'm going to be doing that backend stuff before I get too embroiled in what I'm doing right now.
